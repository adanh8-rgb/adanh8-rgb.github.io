I'm going to graduate in 2029.

# Favorite Labs CPSC 120L

* Lab 5, part 1

   I really enjoyed lab 5 part 1 because of the fact that we have to use loops inside of loops which I believe to be one of my weaknesses so it really put a giant spotlight on loops and I know that loops is a big part in coding so it made me come to a realization that I need to maybe study or do something to come to a greater understanding of the loops.

* Lab 3, part 1

   The bmr calculator was definitely a fun and interesting one my and my partner had our struggles but it was also probably one of the best experiences working through the the problem and learning how to use functions to and looking back at it now it really wasn’t that difficult of a task compared to what labs I am doing today.

* Lab 6, part 1

   I really loved lab 6 part 1 because just the idea of making a sandwich is kind of hilarious to me using code. It was also the introduction to vectors and kind of made me think of the things that vectors can be used to make and how vectors are just a complex idea. It relieves me to think that I actually understand this stuff.
