# Favorite Labs CPSC 120L

* Lab 5, part 1

   I really enjoyed Lab 5 Part 1 because we had to use loops inside of loops, which I believe is one of my weaknesses. It really put a spotlight on my weakness and what I need to work on, and since loops are a big part of coding, it made me realize that I need to study more and work toward a better understanding of them.

* Lab 3, part 1

   The BMR calculator was definitely a fun and interesting one. My partner and I had our struggles, but it was also one of the best experiences because we worked through the problem and learned how to use functions. Looking back at it now, it really wasn’t that difficult of a task compared to the labs I’m doing today.

* Lab 6, part 1

   I really loved Lab 6 Part 1 because the idea of making a sandwich using code is kind of hilarious to me. It was also my introduction to vectors, and it made me think about the things vectors can be used for and how complex they can be. It’s a relief to realize that I actually understand this stuff.
